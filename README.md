# Project---Text-Classification
#### In this text classification project, I focused on categorizing 20 different types of newsgroups using a dataset consisting of 2000 newsletters. Employing the Naive Bayes algorithm, specifically Multinomial Naive Bayes, the project aimed to achieve accurate categorization of documents into their respective newsgroup categories. The preprocessing steps involved tokenization, removal of stopwords, short words, and certain punctuation marks, ensuring the data was appropriately cleaned for machine learning. The feature extraction process relied on selecting features based on word frequencies, employing a bag-of-words representation or a similar approach. The dataset was then split into training and testing sets, with the model achieving an accuracy rate of 74% on the testing set. Possible next steps for improvement include hyperparameter tuning, exploring different feature extraction techniques, comparing the performance of Naive Bayes with other algorithms, conducting error analysis, and considering advanced preprocessing techniques. Overall, the achieved accuracy of 74% marks a solid foundation for further refinement and enhancement of the text classification model.
